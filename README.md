# Tools

This repository contains a selection of tools I created throughout my career to make life easier.

## Requirements

The requirements differ from tool to tool. Generally speaking all tools are written for [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). Also I tend to use [curl](https://curl.se/) quite often so this might be a requirement as well.

Obviously the tools require the specific software whose handling the tools are designed to simplify.

## Setup

It should be sufficient to clone this repository. You may want to add the directory of the directory to your `PATH`.

I recommend something along these lines:

```
git clone '...this repo...' ${HOME}/bin
echo 'PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/bin"' >> ${HOME}/.bashrc
```
